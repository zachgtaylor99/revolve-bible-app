## ✅ Correct File Structure

Your repository should look like this:
```
revolve-bible-app/
├── index.html          ← Main app file
├── assets/             ← CSS and JS files
│   ├── index-xxx.css
│   └── index-xxx.js
├── favicon.ico
├── README.md
├── .nojekyll           ← Prevents Jekyll processing
└── GITHUB-PAGES-SETUP.md
```

## 🚫 What Was Wrong Before

Before (incorrect):
```
revolve-bible-app/
└── revolve-github-pages/    ← Extra folder level
    ├── index.html           ← GitHub couldn't find this
    └── assets/
```

After (correct):
```
revolve-bible-app/
├── index.html               ← GitHub finds this immediately
└── assets/
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Site still shows 404
- Wait 10 minutes after uploading
- Check that `index.html` is in the root directory
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings

### App loads but doesn't work
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all files uploaded correctly
- Try clearing browser cache

### Changes not showing
- Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub to rebuild
- Try hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

## 🎉 Success!

Once working, your app will be:
- ✅ **Live at**: https://zachgtaylor99.github.io/revolve-bible-app
- ✅ **Accessible worldwide**
- ✅ **Free forever**
- ✅ **Automatically HTTPS secured**

---

**This corrected structure will definitely work!**
